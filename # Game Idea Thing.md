## Combat
    different weapons have different base damages
    has a timing based thing that the closer to perfect you are the higher the multiplyer
    and then stregth affects it
        multiply together for the attack damage value
    to attack you press a key when prompted, and then makes damage calculation
    to defend against enemy, you will be prompted to block/ dodge at a time, and if you are close enough 
    to on time, it will succeed, otherwise you will be hit
    the faster player attacks first to start the battle, and then go back and forth
    the stronger the enemy the harder the timing will be to incentivise other items
